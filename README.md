“We, the rustling leaves, have a voice that answers the storms, but who are you so silent?”
# *Hello! I'm a mere flower* 🌱
**Computer Science Student@HUST**

## I Enjoy 
- coding in my *own vibe style* (**not** vibe coding)
- exploring **Computer Graphics** which is hard but fun
- beautifying my **ArchLinux** and writing my **own** config
- drawing,singing,running,exploring... *life beyond the screen*

> ***There are too many things waiting for me to explore.***

## I Hope
As you've seen,I've made no great contributions before.I'm just a nobody in the coding community. <br/>
But at least - <br/>
I can make myself feel archived and excited.And this is exactly what I hope myself to be -- a silent flower that grows in its own way.
