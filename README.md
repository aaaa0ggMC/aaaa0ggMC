**Computer Science Student@HUST**

## I Enjoy 
- coding in my *own vibe style* (**not** vibe coding)
- exploring **Computer Graphics** which is hard but fun
- beautifying my **ArchLinux** and writing my **own** config
- drawing,singing,running,exploring... *life beyond the screen*

> ***There are too many things waiting for me to explore.***

## Programming Languages I used
| Language | Focused on |
| :---:    | :----: |
| **C++** | ComputerGraphics |
| Go | Backend Programming |
| Typescript & Markdown | Blog |
| Bash | Configurations |

## This Year I'm Exploring
| What a Adventure | Appendix |
| :---:    | :----: |
| ComputerGraphics | OpenGL,may switch to Vulkan in the next few years |
| ModernC++ | There are too many things to learn,and I think it's worthwhile | 
| BackendProgramming | Learning for an organization I joined to make servers |
| FrontendProgramming | Just for fun and my blog |
| AI Prompt Writing | I'm trying to craft a roleplay AI prompt gets me |
| Algorithms | For further improvements and for contests and GPA |

## I Hope
As you've seen,I've made no great contributions before.I'm just a nobody in the coding community. But at least -- <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I can make myself feel archived and excited.<br/>And this is exactly what I hope myself to be: <br/>
